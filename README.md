# **Dockerized signin\signup boilerplate**

## Basic

a **simple** multi service **dockrized** project including a **react** frontend, and a **node/ngnix** backend with **postgres** and **redis** providing the data layer.

### Stack:
+ Nginx (reverse proxy) 
+ Node 
+ Postresql 
+ Redis 
+ TypeScript 
+ React 
+ material-ui 
+ Docker

The app and servers are routed through nginx proxy to http://localhost:3050  
**web** service (React app) will be available in http://localhost:3050/  
**auth** service (auth service with jwt based auth & handshake endpoint) will be available in http://localhost:3050/auth/v1/some/route  
**fib** service will be available in http://localhost:3050/fib/v1/some/route  
**worker** just provides a sample (redundant) action just to show the capability.  


## Start up = Development mode

`yarn compose`

### Starting each service

each of the service has a few scripts in common: 

- `start`, for building and starting the app in production mode
- `dev`, for building and starting the app in development mode
- `test`, for running a jest test runner (Enzyme also in the react service)
- `clean` & `clean:mod` will clean dist and node_modules for convinience 

this will start all the services and will expose them in localhost:3050

Enjoy for now.. ðŸ†’
