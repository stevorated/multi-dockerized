# **Dockerized signin\signup boilerplate**

## Basic

a **simple** multi service **dockrized** project including a **react** frontend, and a **node/ngnix** backend with **postgres** and **redis** providing the data layer.

### Stack:
+ Nginx (reverse proxy) 
+ Node 
+ Postresql 
+ Redis 
+ TypeScript 
+ React 
+ material-ui 
+ Docker

## Start up = Development mode ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

add a .env file in the root of the project

here's an example:
~~~~
 APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3050  
 NODE_ENV=development  
 SITE_NAME="my example site"  
 REDIS_HOST=redis  
 REDIS_PORT=6379  
 POSTGRES_HOST=postgres  
 POSTGRES_PORT=5432  
 POSTGRES_DB=auth_db  
 POSTGRES_USER=postgres  
 POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password  
 PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin  
 PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin  
 PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT=80  
 SG_API_KEY=???? (you need to add your key)
 TZ=Asia/Tel_Aviv
 PGTZ=Asia/Tel_Aviv
~~~~
and then...
~~~~
`yarn compose`
~~~~
And You're done! ü§∏

All of the services are routed through nginx proxy to http://localhost:3050  
**web** service (React app) will be available in http://localhost:3050/  
**auth** service (jwt based auth & handshake endpoint) will be available in http://localhost:3050/auth/v1/some/route  
**fib** service will be available in http://localhost:3050/fib/v1/some/route  
**worker** just provides a sample (redundant) action just to show the capability.  

### Starting each service

each of the service has a few scripts in common: 

- `start`, for building and starting the app in production mode
- `dev`, for building and starting the app in development mode
- `test`, for running a jest test runner (Enzyme also in the react service)
- `clean` & `clean:mod` will clean dist and node_modules for convinience 

this will start all the services and will expose them in localhost:3050

Enjoy for now.. üÜí
